Description: This package adds collective parallel read and write capability
             to the R package ncdf4 version 1.8. Typical use is as a
             parallel NetCDF4 file reader in SPMD style programming. Each R
             process reads and writes its own data in a synchronized
             collective mode, resulting in faster parallel performance.
             Performance improvement is conditional on a parallel file system.
SystemRequirements: OpenMPI (>= 1.5.4) on Solaris, Linux and Mac.
        (Parallel) HDF5 and (Parallel) NetCDF4 (4.1 or later)
        libraries. No MPI library required on Windows.
